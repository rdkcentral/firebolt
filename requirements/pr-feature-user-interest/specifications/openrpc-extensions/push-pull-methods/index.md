## 1. Overview
This document describes the Push / Pull Firebolt OpenRPC extension.

Some APIs require both a push and a pull version so that data can be provided on request, or out of band.

To facilitate these APIs, Firebolt denotes an OpenRPC tag with OpenRPC extensions to auto-generate the push notifcation, pull provider, and pull request APIs from the main push API.

This document is written using the [IETF Best Common Practice 14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) and should include the following summary in the Overview section:

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**NOT RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## 3. Push / Pull Extension
Firebolt OpenRPC **MUST** support a method tag named `push-pull` that denotes a method should have a set of pull APIs generated from the current method, which is referred to as the "push method" for the remainder of this section.

If a *any* method has a `push-pull` tag then an additional method named `onRequest<method.Name>` **MUST** be auto-generated by the OpenRPC tooling; This new method is called the "pull provider method" for the remainder of this section.

The pull provider method **MUST** have the `x-response` extension schema set to the schema of the last parameter of the push method.

The pull provider method **MUST** have any remaining parameters (not the last one) from the push method, as these are context parameters used by both push and pull.

The pull provider method **MUST** have the same capabilities tag as the push method.

If a *any* method has a `push-pull` tag then an additional method named `request<method.Name>` **MUST** be auto-generated by the OpenRPC tooling; This new method is called the "pull request method" for the remainder of this section.

The pull request method **MUST** have the `result` schema set to the schema of the last parameter of the push method.

The pull request method **MUST** have any remaining parameters (not the last one) from the push method, as these are context parameters used by both push and pull.

The pull request method **MUST** have the `x-manages` array contain the value of the `x-provides` value from the push method.

If a *any* method has a `push-pull` tag then an additional method named `on<method.Name>` **MUST** be auto-generated by the OpenRPC tooling; This new method is called the "push notification method" for the remainder of this section.

The push notification method **MUST** have the `result` schema set to the schema of the last parameter of the push method.

The push notification method **MUST** have any remaining parameters (not the last one) from the push method, as these are context parameters used by both push and pull.

The push notification method **MUST** have the `x-uses` array contain the value of the `x-provides` value from the push method.
