## 1. Overview

App developers need to know which audio and video formats can be successfully played on a Firebolt device and its attached peripherals.

An audio format includes values such as the audio codec, container, codec level, and bit rate of the audio stream.

A video format may include values such as the video container, format/codec, HDR profile, and resolution of the video stream.

Further, apps may also need to know about the media format currently playing in the media pipeline.

An app may need to check IP video playback that it has initiated to see if Dolby Audio is in fact active (as opposed to just present in the encoded data) in order to display metadata or badges to the user. Apps may also be playing [user-cultivated media](../media-access), and therefore have no metadata about the format of the files.

A first-party app may need to check all [Media Pipelines](../media-pipeline) for media format characteristics to display a global badge.

Additionally, apps may need to know what is supported by the device, *before* initiating any media playback.

To solve this, Firebolt APIs will be created to detect the formats and codecs currently being decoded by the [Media Pipeline](../media-pipeline).  Firebolt APIs will also be created to query whether the device and its peripherals support playing content of various formats.

### 1.1. User Stories

#### 1.1.1. As an OTT App developer

I want to know what is supported by the device and it's active AV chain:

- I want to know if content of a particular video or audio format (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HEVC, etc.) is supported
- I want to know if content decoding with a particular codec profile or level (HEVC Main 10, VP9 Profile 2, etc.) is supported.
- I want to know whether content of a particular resolution and frame rate is supported

I want to know what kind of content I'm currently playing:

- I want to know which video or audio format the media I'm currently playing is sending to the decoder.
- I want to know which video or audio format profile or level the media I'm currently playing is being sent to the decoder.
- I want to know what resolution and frame rate is currently being sent to the decoder.

#### 1.1.2. As a first-party App developer

I want to show an audio/videophile overlay with detailed information:

- I want to know all video or audio formats that are currently being sent to a decoder.
- I want to know all video or audio format profiles/levels currently being sent to a decoder.
- I want to know all resolution and framerates currently being sent to a decoder.
